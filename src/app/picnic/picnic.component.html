            <p class="card-text">Ram Kund is a holy place for Hindus. Devotees believe that a dip in this tank will fulfill their wishes and also free them from their sins. There is a popular belief that salvation to the soul of the dead person is easily achieved by immersing their ashes in the holy waters of this tank. Ashes of prominent personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, and Dr. Rajendra Prasad were immersed in Ram Kund. Adjacent to the Ramkund, there is a Gandhi Talav (lake) having a white marbled monument, built-in memory of Mahatma Gandhi.
